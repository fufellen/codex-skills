# Skill Management

## Canonical Location

Create and update user-owned Codex skills in the Google Drive synced Obsidian vault by default:

```text
C:\Users\User\Мой диск\Obsidian\.codex\skills
```

This synced folder is the canonical source of truth for the user's personal skills. It lets the user keep the same skill instructions, scripts, references, assets, and tool notes across PCs through Google Drive synchronization.

## GitHub Mirror

The Google Drive skill folder is also mirrored to GitHub:

```text
https://github.com/fufellen/codex-skills
```

Local git repository path:

```text
C:\Users\User\Мой диск\Obsidian\.codex\skills
```

After materially creating or updating user-owned skills, commit and push the skill changes to this repository by default unless the user explicitly says not to. Before committing:

1. Check `git status --short`.
2. Make sure `secrets/`, API keys, tokens, local credentials, caches, and generated logs are not staged.
3. Stage only relevant skill files and repo metadata.
4. Use a concise commit message describing the skill update.
5. Push to `origin main`.

If push fails because credentials, network, or remote permissions are unavailable, keep the local commit if it was created and report the exact blocker.

## Corporate NTO Submodule

The `nto-formatting` skill is corporate-primary and is stored as a Git submodule inside the personal skills repository.

```text
Corporate source of truth: https://github.com/ak-tech-electronics/codex-skills
Personal repo with submodule: https://github.com/fufellen/codex-skills
Submodule path in personal repo: nto-formatting
```

The corporate repo root is the skill folder itself: it must contain `SKILL.md` at repo root, plus optional `agents/`, `references/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/` folders. Do not nest it as `nto-formatting/SKILL.md` inside the corporate repo.

Keep personal-repo details out of the corporate `nto-formatting` skill. The personal repository knows that it consumes the corporate repo as a submodule; the corporate repo should only describe itself as the NTO skill source of truth and may refer generically to downstream mirrors or submodules.

Do not pull the NTO submodule on every ordinary skill use. Use this freshness model instead:

- For normal NTO drafting or review, use the local submodule checkout as-is.
- Before editing the NTO skill, applying self-learning updates, or publishing changes, run `git -C nto-formatting fetch origin main`.
- Compare `git -C nto-formatting rev-parse HEAD` with `git -C nto-formatting rev-parse origin/main`.
- If the submodule is behind and clean, fast-forward it with `git -C nto-formatting merge --ff-only origin/main`.
- If the submodule is dirty, ahead, or diverged, stop and report the state before editing.
- Use `git submodule update --remote nto-formatting` only when the user explicitly asks to sync to the latest corporate version without making a skill edit.

When `nto-formatting` is materially updated:

1. Work inside the submodule path or a fresh corporate repo clone.
2. Validate the skill in the corporate repo root.
3. Commit and push the corporate repo first.
4. Return to the personal repo, verify that `nto-formatting` points at the new corporate commit.
5. Commit and push the updated submodule pointer in the personal repo.
6. Report both commit hashes.

Do not duplicate the corporate NTO skill as ordinary tracked files in the personal repo. On a fresh clone of the personal repo, initialize submodules with `git submodule update --init --recursive`; when updating from the corporate `main` branch, use `git submodule update --remote nto-formatting`.

## Default Rule

- When creating a new user skill, place it under the Google Drive synced skill folder above unless the user explicitly asks for another location.
- When updating an existing user skill, prefer the Google Drive copy if one exists.
- Do not create independent duplicated skill instructions under `C:\Users\User\.codex\skills` unless the user explicitly asks.
- Treat local non-synced skill folders as temporary bootstrap pointers, cache, or system-managed content, not as the durable home for user preferences.
- Do not commit or push synced secrets; keep `secrets/` folders and local credential files ignored.
- If a user gives a durable preference about how skills should be created, updated, named, synced, or used, add it to this skill or the relevant domain skill without waiting for another reminder.

## Existing Google Drive Skills

- `scientific-work` currently lives at:

```text
C:\Users\User\Мой диск\Obsidian\.codex\skills\scientific-work
```

- `knowledge-refactoring` currently lives at:

```text
C:\Users\User\Мой диск\Obsidian\.codex\skills\knowledge-refactoring
```

- `nto-formatting` currently lives at:

```text
C:\Users\User\Мой диск\Obsidian\.codex\skills\nto-formatting
```

- Presentation workflow rules for scientific/popular-science decks currently live at:

```text
C:\Users\User\Мой диск\Obsidian\.codex\skills\scientific-work\references\presentation-workflow.md
```

## Creating New Skills

When creating a new skill from scratch:

1. Use the system `skill-creator` guidance.
2. Initialize the skill in:

```text
C:\Users\User\Мой диск\Obsidian\.codex\skills
```

3. Keep `SKILL.md` concise.
4. Put detailed workflows in `references/`.
5. Put deterministic utilities in `scripts/`.
6. Put templates and reusable media in `assets/`.
7. Validate the skill with the skill-creator validation script when feasible.

## Updating Existing Skills

Before editing a skill:

1. Check whether a Google Drive version exists.
2. Edit the Google Drive version first.
3. Avoid editing system skills under `.system` unless the user explicitly asks and the file is intended to be user-modifiable.
4. After updating, tell the user exactly which skill or reference file changed.

## Cross-PC Expectations

For a skill to be useful on another PC:

- its folder should be inside the synced Google Drive skill root;
- scripts and references should use relative paths where possible;
- absolute paths may mention the expected vault root, but should explain that Google Drive sync must place the vault at the same or adapted path;
- secrets should not be duplicated unless the user explicitly requests synced secrets for convenience;
- if a local connector or plugin is required, document how to test it from the synced skill.

## Relationship To Domain Skills

Use this skill for general rules about skill storage and synchronization. Use domain skills for domain behavior:

- scientific notes, papers, PhD work, Obsidian research workflows: `scientific-work`;
- scientific and technical report / NTO formatting: `nto-formatting`;
- presentation-specific behavior for research talks: `scientific-work/references/presentation-workflow.md`;
- Obsidian REST/MCP bridge details: `scientific-work/references/obsidian-ai-integration.md`.
