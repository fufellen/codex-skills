# Plasmonics Photonics

## Purpose

Use this skill for the user's specialized plasmonic and photonic research context. It narrows broad scientific work into domain-specific reasoning about guided optical modes, plasmonic waveguides, PCM photonics, reduced-order models, and full-wave validation.

For general Obsidian note style, checkpoint discipline, paper-note structure, term-note capture, and PhD vault hygiene, use the general `scientific-work` rules when available. This skill adds the plasmonics/photonics physics and claim-control layer.

## Self-Improvement And Publishing

When plasmonics-photonics work reveals a durable, reusable lesson, use the `skill-learning` policy. Save compact domain rules, validation checks, reusable modeling patterns, source-audit lessons, or formula conventions in this skill or a focused `references/<topic>.md` file. Do not store secrets, credentials, private raw datasets, unpublished full measurements, copyrighted source text, generated logs, raw project/customer material, or one-off project facts in the skill.

Before materially editing this skill, applying self-learning updates, or publishing changes, run the owning repository's freshness check: fetch `origin main`, compare local `HEAD` with `origin/main`, fast-forward if local is behind and the relevant working tree is clean, and inspect dirty/ahead/diverged states before continuing.

After materially updating this skill, validate it when feasible, then commit and push the relevant skill changes to the owning repository by default unless the user explicitly says not to. Stage only relevant skill files and repository metadata.

If publishing encounters remote changes or merge conflicts, resolve them autonomously when the intended final meaning can be determined from the files, commit history, nearby rules, and the user's instruction. Preserve compatible rules from both sides, consolidate duplicates, rerun validation, commit the resolved result, and push. Stop only when resolution would require guessing unavailable technical meaning, exposing protected content, discarding user work, or using unavailable repository permissions.

## Start Of Work

For nontrivial domain work, first preserve context:
- read or create the nearest project-local `CODEX/Контекст задачи Codex - <topic>.md` or `CODEX/План задачи Codex - <topic>.md`;
- record the objective, current status, local source notes/files, key formulas, numerical facts, caveats, assumptions, and next steps;
- keep reviewed-works registers for literature and source audits;
- after compaction, interruption, or a long gap, read the active goal/plan and project checkpoint before substantive reasoning.

For reusable plasmonics/photonics calculation code, mode-analysis scripts, and validated diagnostics, make intermediate git commits when a repository is available and the user has not opted out. A commit is useful when the code is reproducible and scientifically interpretable: it either agrees with an analytic estimate, literature value, previous COMSOL/FEM/CST result, or another check, or it exposes a meaningful discrepancy. Commit messages or nearby notes should state what the result was compared against and whether the status is `validated`, `diagnostic`, `discrepant`, or `unverified`. Do not commit bulky raw solver artifacts such as large `.mph` files unless the user explicitly wants them versioned.

Search local PhD/vault context before giving scientific conclusions. Prefer local notes, model diaries, PDFs, extracted tables, scripts, and COMSOL/CST logs over memory. Mark uncertain statements as hypotheses.

## Domain Workflow

Separate every task into four layers:
- **physics:** SPP/DLSPP/LR-DLSPP mode type, confinement, light-line position, cutoff/leaky behavior, material overlap;
- **materials:** optical constants, PCM state, wavelength, composition, crystallization assumption, metal loss convention;
- **method:** analytic dispersion, EIM/ЭДП, transfer matrix, FEM/COMSOL, CST, volume integral, FDTD, or experiment;
- **claim:** what the result can and cannot support in an article, report, or dissertation.

For PCM/plasmonic phase shifter work, compare state-paired metrics rather than isolated states:
- $Re(n_\mathrm{eff})$, $Im(n_\mathrm{eff})$, and $\beta=k_0n_\mathrm{eff}$;
- $\Delta Re(n_\mathrm{eff})$ between amorphous and crystalline states;
- $L_\pi=\lambda_0/(2\Delta Re(n_\mathrm{eff}))$;
- propagation length and loss per length;
- insertion loss on $L_\pi$;
- branch identity and field overlap.

## Validation Rules

For EIM/ЭДП and other reduced-order models:
- treat them as screening/pre-design tools unless full validation supports stronger claims;
- use them confidently for phase-trend checks only after confirming the mode branch is meaningful;
- never present agreement in $L_\pi$ as proof of accurate absolute loss;
- mark no-root or fallback values as `EIM-breakdown / no valid root`, not ordinary numerical results;
- retain negative examples as part of a failure atlas.

For COMSOL/FEM/CST mode analysis:
- define the sign convention for $Im(n_\mathrm{eff})$, $\operatorname{Im}\beta$, propagation length, dB/length, and dB/$\pi$;
- validate mesh, domain size, PML/boundary settings, and material assignments before calling a solver result a reference;
- track modes by field profile, overlap integral, confinement factor, and power distribution rather than by fixed mode number alone;
- check whether residual loss comes from PCM, metal absorption, radiation/leaky channels, boundaries/PML, or numerical artifacts.

For literature and article claims:
- do not claim a first PCM modulator, first PCM phase shifter, first plasmonic PCM device, or first EIM use for DLSPP unless primary literature verification supports it;
- frame EIM/ЭДП work as a failure-aware screening workflow when loss metrics diverge from FEM;
- distinguish EIM/effective-index waveguide reduction from EMA/effective-medium approximation for partially crystallized PCM;
- cite primary papers or official solver documentation for claims about device performance, solver behavior, or method limitations.
